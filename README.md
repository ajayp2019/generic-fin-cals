# Generic Financial Calculators

This repository contains a collection of financial calculators that can be used to calculate various financial metrics. The calculators are written in Python.

This is, quite honestly, my first attempt at creating a public repository on GitHub. It is very likely that this repository has code that is already available in better format elsewhere. However, I wanted to create this repository as a way to learn more about GitHub and to practice my Python coding skills. I am open to any and all feedback, so please feel free to reach out to me with any suggestions or comments.

I use GitHub Copilot to help me write the code. 

Finally - I am not a financial advisor. Please consult with a financial advisor before making any financial decisions. This is just for fun and learning.
